### Inputs

  input * {
    xkb_layout no
  }

  input "1267:8661:ELAN_Touchscreen" {
    # By default the input from the touchscreen on the laptop will map to a
    # position on the "global output layout", meaning that if e.g. an external
    # output is connected and positioned to the right of the laptop then touch
    # events on the right side of the laptop screen will go to the external
    # output... We prevent this by forcing all events from the laptop screen to
    # go to the laptop output:
    map_to_output eDP-1
